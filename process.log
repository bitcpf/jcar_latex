Need to clearify:

July 9th Morning, try to find FCC rules.


FCC approved white space channels in different cities

Capacity calucation. In Robinson's paper, what's the demand from the measurement?

Should merge the virtual cities and propagation in one sec? Or actually the virtual cities just different propagation area with different bandwidth which is not actual cities.

Problem formulation
	Describe the gains in model.tex

Coverage metric
	Percents?
Connection metric
	RSSI threshold
Input info
	WiEye data in 2.4 getting information of different cities
	Local data to link ISM bands and UHF bands
Variable:
	Propagation
	White space band

Algorithms

Experiment design
	Talk about the AP searching
	Propagation estimate from AP and measured data

Metric/:

Connectivity
Nodes amount
Network capacity
Delay?
Multiband radios

Add more words from what talked on Fri.

Capacity calculation: Fairness/Capacity???

I	Introduction

II	Problem Formulation
		Need to tell the capacity calculation
III	Propagation in cities as a sec
		1. Concept of propogation
		2. Propogation fomular, introduce the factors
IV	Explain candidate cities
	Four different cities reason
	Each city of different character
	another: originize by topic
	improving capacity

V 	Results results
	four cities
	compare rsults
