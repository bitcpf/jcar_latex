Need to clearify:

The capacity model may need to modified
Greedy from this capacity model is not good.

The data process of RSSI may try median value instead of average value

Idea may try:
Adjust the Minhop transship cost calculation


Running Program:
Brute forth on genuse30:6 save as max_cap_aug1
May need to run multiband brute forth on another server
Solve the Matlab+AMPL linear to solve transship problem, need to implement all the algorithm

For single band:
Brute force has done
Greedy has done

WinLab experiments:
	Validate the capacity as in Robinson's paper
	Get throughput of a fully backlogged whitespace band in WINLAB
Infield experiment:
	Map the propagation characteristics of local measurement


How to show results: 
	Metric capacity
	Variable : # of adding nodes; # of bands; # of environment


write experiments in detail

Writing:
Try to understand Robinson second algorithm and implant to multiband
Clearify the experiment and evaluation set up
After understand Robinson's second algorithm, need to re-formulate the draft
Analyze the complexity of the algorithms


Coding and Simulation:
Two tier mesh networks
Focus on backhaul but need to consider the access tier interference
Add capacity calculation validating form Robinson
Transship problem
Knapsack problem
Evaluation Set up
Data Collection

July 30: Capacity calculation/ Brute force search


Data Collection
1. Already have
Down, campus, park, neighborhood
May need data of rural through wieye


Inherit from Robinson
Math model

Difference from Robinson


have different cost for building a mesh node according to radios, otherwise Robinson's local search algorithm could be implanted for multiband

With the assign operation, the operation times could be decreased by an amount, could be claimed as contribution?

Define an interference parameter for access tier which will reduce the sharing of ISM band for the mesh node


FCC approved white space channels in different cities

Capacity calucation. In Robinson's paper, what's the demand from the measurement?

Should merge the virtual cities and propagation in one sec? Or actually the virtual cities just different propagation area with different bandwidth which is not actual cities.

Problem formulation
	Describe the gains in model.tex

Coverage metric
	Percents?
Connection metric
	RSSI threshold
Input info
	WiEye data in 2.4 getting information of different cities
	Local data to link ISM bands and UHF bands
Variable:
	Propagation
	White space band

Algorithms

Experiment design
	Talk about the AP searching
	Propagation estimate from AP and measured data

Metric/:

Connectivity
Nodes amount
Network capacity
Delay?
Multiband radios

Add more words from what talked on Fri.

Capacity calculation: Fairness/Capacity???

I	Introduction

II	Problem Formulation
		Need to tell the capacity calculation
III	Propagation in cities as a sec
		1. Concept of propogation
		2. Propogation fomular, introduce the factors
IV	Explain candidate cities
	Four different cities reason
	Each city of different character
	another: originize by topic
	improving capacity

V 	Results results
	four cities
	compare rsults


Difference from Robison:
1. Multiband vs single channel


Experiments:
Resove the tranship and knapsack problem
