\section{Evaluation of WhiteMesh Channel Assignment}
\label{sec:experimentdesign}


We now extensively evaluate our proposed measurement-driven heuristic algorithm against the upper 
bound approaching formed by our integer linear program and versus prior channel 
assignment strategies. We introduce the topologies and metric calculation used 
in the analysis and present a set of results based on the linear program and heuristic algorithm.

\subsection{Experimental Evaluation Setup}
\label{subsec:design}
% Simulation Setup
A key aspect of WhiteMesh networks is the diversity in propagation from the lowest white
space channels (tens to hundreds of MHz) to the highest WiFi channels (multiple GHz). Thus, 
to evaluate the performance of our measurement-driven algorithms, we consider a wide range 
of propagation characteristics from four different frequency bands.  For white space bands, 
we choose 450 and 800 MHz, for WiFi bands, we choose 2.4 and 5.8 GHz according to the measurements
from~\cite{pcuiwinmee}. 
There are 9 measurements in~\cite{pcuiwinmee}, we check the population from US census~\cite{uscensus} mapping
the activity level to the population for each bands as Table.~\ref{tab:actlevel}.
The measurements tells the relation among population distribution, traffic demand,
and available channel capacity of multiple bands. The more population, the more traffic demand
and potentially less channel capacity in WiFi channels. We grab the measurements to calculate
the available channel capacity $\delta$ as input for our algorithm which makes the channel 
capacity of the bands are not equal but more practical. With similar transmission
power and antenna gain, the highest carrier frequency would have the shortest communication range.
Hence, we set a communication-range threshold of -100 dBm, and normalize the communication 
range with the highest frequency of 5.8 GHz. In particular, the communication range of 
450 MHz, 800 MHz, 2.4 GHz, and 5.8 GHz would be normalized to 12.8, 6.2, 2.4, and 1, respectively 
according to Eq.~\ref{eq:friis}. The interference range is computed as twice that of the communication 
range~\cite{raniwala2005architecture}. We deploy static wireless mesh networks of $n$ 
mesh nodes along a regular, rectangular grid with a normalized distance of 0.8 between rectangular edges. 
As a result, we have varying degrees of connectivity in the grid.
The gateways are chosen through a typical cell hexagon deployment method based on 2.4 GHz~\cite{meguerdichian2001exposure}.
Unless otherwise, specified in the analysis, all four bands are used in the WhiteMesh
topology studied. For practical application, more channels could be involved in the 
algorithm.

The throughput achieved through the gateways is not only critical for network vendors (e.g., cellular
carriers charge fees for total bandwidth through towers), but also has been used by researchers
to evaluate channel assignment~\cite{avallone2008channel}.  As mentioned previously, the wireless
capacity of gateway nodes has been shown to be the bottleneck in mesh networks~\cite{robinson2010deploying}.
Moreover, traffic arrived gateway combines multiple factors, such as mesh node placement, gateway placement, 
routing, and channel assignment, the latter of which is the focus of our analysis and algorithms. 
For the purposes of our analysis, we specifically calculate the traffic arrived gateway first introduced
in Section~\ref{subsec:problem} in the following way.  Mesh nodes that have a close hop count path to the gateway
nodes are the first ones served. Where there are nodes with the same hop count, the least interfering
mesh nodes are chosen for serving. Then, the demand of multihop mesh nodes are served 
until there is no remaining demand to be satisfied or there is no remaining channel capacity through any path.

% NEWClaim fix, map mesh node offer load to population distribution
We vary the average population distribution and the available channel capacity according to~\cite{pcuiwinmee}
 of the target area, assuming $10\%$ of the residents will use
our service. An individual would have a $100 KB/s$ traffic demand on average. 
Then, we assign the demand to users randomly under the same average value across the area and run the analysis 
of each case 20 times as the simulation configuration. Through the assignment, the traffic arrived at gateway nodes
and the network throughput are calculated.
To approach the traffic arrived gateway upbound, we relax our ILP model to keep the link capacity constraints, 
given the demand of the mesh nodes as a parameter to achieve the maximum throughput at the gateways. 
The ILP Bound calculation make the mesh nodes activate all possible connection the gateways if 
there exists a path.
However, the three heuristic algorithms provide assignment each mesh node has connection only to one 
gateway in the network, and this reduce the dynamic changes for the assignment, which could be implemented
by updating the assignment in a short term through the heuristic algorithms.

% ILP bound

Typically, clients and mesh nodes have diverse traffic patterns with
the download direction dominating the total traffic demand (e.g., consider
service agreements for cellular data or Internet connectivity). Hence, to
simplify the analysis and scale the ILP Bound to larger network sizes, we 
only consider the download traffic while maintaining the simulations.
We then randomly assign distributed download traffic demand per 
mesh node with a maximum offered load as specified in Fig.~\ref{fig:all3figs} 
and Table~\ref{tab:2channelcombination}. We average the results of 20 simulations 
each of the algorithms for the given network configuration and compare 
the results to analyze multiband application in wireless network.

In the first experiment, we consider different network sizes according to
the number of mesh nodes in the aforementioned regular grid. 
As the network size grows, so too does the number of gateways through the 
hexagon gateway nodes deployment. 
Fig.~\ref{fig:varysize} shows the total traffic arrived gateways when the 
population distribution is 500 $ppl/km^2$ for the ILP formulation and 
the heuristic algorithms: 
{\it (i)} Common Channel Assignment (CCA) from~\cite{draves2004routing},
{\it (ii)} Breadth First Search Channel Assignment (BFS-CA) from~\cite{ramachandran2006interference},
{\it (iv)} our algorithm BPS (Section~\ref{subsec:BPS}).
In typical CCA~\cite{draves2004routing} algorithm, two nodes will assign a common channel 
for each other when both of them share free radios working in the same channel. 
In BFS-CA~\cite{tang2005interference} algorithm, a node will search all the 
available one-hop connections then choose the one has the largest available capacity for a new assignment. 
These two methods focus on multi-channel assuming the one-hop connections are equal 
when there is no assignment on the channel. 
In BPS, we both consider and leverage propagation differences of diverse bands.



In Fig.~\ref{fig:varysize}, we observe as the network size increase, the performance
difference goes up. When the network size which represent the size of target area, 
the multiband wireless network has similar communication and interference performance
with the multi-channel wireless network since all the nodes are located in a limited 
space where could be communicated/interferred by all the bands. As network size increase,
the connection/interference variation among multiple bands makes the performance of 
multi-channel algorithms stay in low level.
The ILP Bound shows what could be expected, that an 
increasing number of gateways/mesh nodes produce an increase in total
traffic arrived gateways.  
However, we observe that CCA, BFSCA algorithms are not able
to achieve such behavior for various reasons. CCA fails to employ the 
communication range variation and find the most efficient hop connections 
which increase the average hop count.  
BFS-CA optimizes the first connection hop from the gateway, but fails
to deal the whole path from the gateway to destination node.
Conversely, BPS alleviates the strain on these first-hop, bottleneck 
links, achieving up to 87\% of the ILP Bound. The difference of BPS to the
ILP is that BPS only considers static one path to a gateway node for each mesh node,
whereas the ILP allows multiple paths to the gateways. For BPS the dynamic could
be implemented through updating the assignment in a short term.

% Simulation set up
Next, we consider a different form of scalability in our analysis.  Namely,
we increase the average population distribution from 100 to 1,000 per km$^2$, while
maintaining a 49-node regular grid topology. 
In the simulation set up, we map the channel capacity to the closest population
measurement results. If there are measurements has the same distance to the current
set up, the lower population measurement will be chosen, for instance, we map 
$400 ppl/km^2$ to $300 ppl/km^2$ measurements.
Fig.~\ref{fig:maxtpt} shows that as the population distribution increases, the ILP
and BPS diverge greatly from the remaining algorithms. 
Similar to Fig.~\ref{fig:varysize}, the wireless channel capacity around a gateway is quickly 
saturated if the algorithm is not focused on preserving that resource. 
Another factor of the performance is the channel capacity, as population increase
the measured channel capacity vary as shown in Table~\ref{tb:activitymeasurement}.
As the population reaches 1,000, the traffic arrived gateways decrease due to the 
channel capacity and the saturation of wireless channel capacity around the gateway
nodes. BPS has a performance of 60\% of the ILP Bound, on average. CCA and BFS-CA
fails to serve more traffic demand through the jointly WiFi and white space wireless
network. 


WhiteMesh networks could be deployed across a vast array of environments, from
rural to urban areas.  Each of these areas will have varying amounts of user
demand traffic in proportion to the population densities.  However, since a greater
number of TV stations exist in urban areas, the available white space bands are
often inversely related to the population density due to the FCC rules~\cite{fccwhitespace} 
and the in-field channel occupancy. To capture these varying
degrees of demand and white space availability we consider three likely scenarios
and one final scenario for comparison purposes: {\it (i)} two WiFi bands (2.4 and
5.8 GHz) channels with two white space channels (450 and 800 MHz), {\it (ii)} three channels in two WiFi
bands (2.4 and 5.8 GHz) with one white space channel (450 MHz), {\it (iii)} Four channels in two
WiFi bands (2.4 and 5.8 GHz) without any white space channels, and {\it (iv)}
four channels in two white space bands (450 and 800 MHz) with no WiFi bands (for comparison).



In Fig.~\ref{fig:wifiws}, we consider the performance of BPS in the four aforementioned
scenarios of varying white space availability with varying offered load from 1 to 10 Mbps,
representing different population densities. A regular, 49-node grid is again used.
Immediately, we observe that the WiFi-only scenario has greater traffic arrived gateways
than the white-space-only scenario.  This is due to the lack of spatial reuse achieved
by white spaces. White space has larger communication to shorten the hop counts as well as 
has larger interference reducing the spatial reuse. Another reason is that the available 
channel capacity of 500 $ppl/km^2$ in white space bands are worse than WiFi bands. 
This two reasons make the white space only has worse performance no matter what channel
assignment methods are applied.

Table~\ref{tab:2channelcombination} describes the achieved traffic arrived gateways for various
combinations of WiFi and white space bands with a maximum offered load of 5 Mbps from 500 $ppl/km^2$ in
a regular 49-node grid. 
In the simulation, we keep 4 channels for each method, such as in the combination of
2.4 GHz and 5 GHz, we put 2 channels in both bands. In the triple bands combinations,
we set each band has a channel, and put the other channel in the highest frequency band.
(In 2.4 GHz, 5GHz, 800 MHz combination, we put the extra channel other than the 3 channel each 
band in 5 GHz). 
Interestingly, however, the joint use of both white space and WiFi
bands has significant gains over the single type of band scenarios with the same number 
of channels (40\% greater than WiFi and 56\% over white space, on average).  
The channel combination we show in Fig.~\ref{fig:wifiws} as Wifi(2)+WS(1) has
2 channels in 5 GHz and 1 channel in 2.4 GHz and 800 MHz. Since in 500 $ppl/km^2$ scenario,
5 GHz channel is cleaner than 450 MHz which makes this combination has better performance than
WiFi(2)+WS(2).  Obviously, in Table~\ref{tab:2channelcombination} that 
with the same number of available bands (2), when the combination has similar propagation
characters, such as one in WiFi band, one in white space band, the combination has 
clean channels have better performance. With similar channel capacity, lower frequency
offers more option for connection path could output a better channel assignment.   
If we have one channel in a white space band and one 
channel in a WiFi band, then we could use the advantage of WiFi for spatial reuse
and white spaces to reduce the hop count. 

These characteristics become more critical at
different points in the WhiteMesh topology. For the sake of completeness, we present
many other scenarios which could be interesting for WhiteMesh channel assignment
and deployment.

In Fig.~\ref{fig:networktpt}, the network througput has the same characters
as the traffic arrived gateways. In a small network size, white space bands
do not show great improvement in network throughput defined in~\ref{eq:networktpt}.
As the network size goes up, the BPS shows improvement upto 30\%
over CCA and BFS-CA methods which focus on multi-channel scenarios.
The network could be achieved when all the assigned links are fully employed
simultanesouly and a strict equal fairness obeyed by all clients.
