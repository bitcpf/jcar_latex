\section{Propagation in Multiband Mesh Network}
\label{sec:propogation}

% Concept of propogation, factors of the environment and so on



% Propogation fomular, explain the band influence
 For wireless networks, the received signal power of a node is represented as $P_{dBm}(d)=P_{dBm}-10\alpha log_{10}(\frac{d}{d_0})+\epsilon$. Pathloss exponent $\alpha$ in outdoor environments range from 2 to 5, higher frequency has a heavier pathloss. \cite{camp2006measurement}. 
The propagation of frequency becomes an important characteristic since the pathloss exponent varies with channel frequency. The propagation difference makes the performance of radios vary from band to band in the same location. 
Specifying each link individually enables us to encode propagation characteristics of different bands $B$. In other words, each grid can be covered by an arbitrary node through specific band.  
The propagation alternation brings the advantages of providing more possible path for multihop network without increase interference of their neighbors.
