\section{Mixed Linear Integer Solution}
\label{sec:linearopt}


Based on the analyze a ~\emph{Mixed Linear Integer Model} is built to describe the problem.                                        
To provide affordable solution for ~\emph{Channel Assignment Problem} in multiband scenario, a novel parameter ~\emph{Network Efficiency} is defined to represent the performance of multi-hop path in multiband mesh network.
The influence of ~\emph{White Space Band} influence on the network is presented based on this parameter in this section.
