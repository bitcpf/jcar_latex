%Why need energy efficiency.
Energy efficiency is becoming increasingly important for small form factor mobile devices~\cite{miao2008energy}.
In some scenarios, keep the link is much more important than have a good throughput, such as hiking, camping.
As the battery technology has not kept up with the requirements to provide more energy, the only we can make the devices working longer is to get a high energy efficiency. 

%Fundamental issues
Energy-efficient communications has been studied for at least two decades~\cite{miao2009cross}. Information theory has built the quantization metric for energy-efficient~\cite{meshkati2005energy}.
