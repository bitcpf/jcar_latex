Since FCC ruling obviated mandatory spectrum sensing in whtie spaces networks, prior research in UHF white spaces has focused on accurate detecting the primary user ~\cite{kim2008fast}; assigning white spaces channels ~\cite{bahl2009white}.
In ~\cite{murty2012senseless}, database is applied to detect white space channel.
Employing the energy advantage of UHF bands is proposed to improve the performance for indoor networks ~\cite{radunovic2010rethinking}.   


In ~\cite{robinson2010deploying}, a placement algorithm for wireless mesh networks is proposed for white space bands.

However, these works only focus on white space bands fails to connect the ISM bands and tons fo existing wireless devices for pratical application.

 %Multichannel works
 Tons of works have been done for multichannel multiradio.

 Cognitive Radios


% Heternegeous networks
