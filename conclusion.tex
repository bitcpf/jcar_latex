\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we exploited the joint use of WiFi and white space bands for 
improving the served user demand of wireless mesh networks in pratical scenarios.
To do so, we used an integer programming model with in-field measurements
 to find optimal WhiteMesh channel assignment.  
We then constructed a heuristic algorithms involve measurements, Band-based Path Selection, to 
approach optimal performance with reduced complexity. Through 
extensive analysis across varying offered loads, network sizes, and white space 
channel availability, we show that our algorithms can achieve 2 to 5 times the served
user demand versus previous multi-channel, multi-radio solutions in multiband scenarios, 
since we leverage diverse propagation characteristics offered by WiFi and white space bands.  Moreover,
we quantify the degree to which the joint use of these bands can improve the served
user demand. Our BPS algorithm shows that WhiteMesh topologies can achieve up to 
170\% of the traffic arrvied gateways of similar WiFi- or white-space-only configurations.
