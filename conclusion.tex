\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we investigated the channel assignment in multi-band scenario to leverage the propagation incluence for mesh network applications. 
We have presented the multi-band mesh network architecture, a new defination of path interference over network, and analyze the advantages and disadvantages of white space bands.
According to the analysis, we formally propose Best Path Selection and Growing Spanning Tree algorithms for channel assignment in multi-band network. Simulation results show that our scheme outperforms the existing scheme substantially.

Dynamic and distributed algorithms for multi-band channel assignment problems will be of our future work.
