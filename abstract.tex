Wireless mesh network deployments are low cost effective way to serve large populations internet connections. As the network usage grows, more mesh networks may need to improve the performance serving the neighborhoods. 
However, this may bring more contention for existing network. 
Since FCC freed UHF band for wireless communication, to deploy mesh networks in white band could bring additional capacity for existing capacity. 
In this paper, we study the problem of adding new capacity to an existing mesh network with multiband gateways.
We first present a protocol model based multiband capacity calculation for gateway-limited fair capacity as a function of the networks.
Then we introduce a global measurement strategy estimating link capacity saving tons of measurement work in neighborhoods.
Then, we present multiband online gateway placement algorithms that use local search operations to joint assign channel and routing on multiband network.
Multiband links make the network topology complex bringing a NP-hard problem. 
The challenges are addressed with a placement algorithm with linear optimization.
The algorithm is validate in single band scenario on Orbit grid.
The results show that the algorithms outperform the FIXME (Heuristic IGW/ Degreebased) by up to FIXME on realistic topologies.
