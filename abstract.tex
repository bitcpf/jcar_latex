Many efforts has been devoted to resolve the channel assignment problem for multi-channel multi-radio mesh network these years.
The solutions of these works are focusing on the optimization for multi-radios network have channels working in close frequency.
In this paper, we propose a multiband multiradio wireless mesh networking architecture has multiple channels with large gaps in frequency. In such a mesh network, each mesh node is equipped multiple radios work in a set of frequency with different propagation characteristics.
Though multi-band multi-radio bring benefit for mesh network, the channel assignment problem is an NP-hard problem.

To resolve this problem, we first 
analyze the factors of the network and bring a novel parameter path efficiency over network to describe the network performance and present two algorithms according to the analysis to approach the optimized solution.
Finally a performance study is carried out to access the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm. 
The results shows that these two algorithms can resolve the problem in polynomial time with better performance over Common Channel Assignment and Breath First Search Channel Assignment.
