\section{backhaul Algorithm and Evaluation}
\label{sec:whitemesh}

% Organization of the Sec
In this section, we study the channel assignment problem jointly when using WiFi and white space 
bands in concert across the backhaul tier of a wireless mesh network. We then present our linear programming model and 
heuristic-based measurement-driven algorithm to address the problem. 
 
\subsection{Linear Programming Formulation}
\label{subsec:linearopt}

The function of the backhaul tier is to wirelessly provide end to end traffic to and from the user and Internet.
% Metrics
In practice, the traffic demand of the users obeys a Poisson process~\cite{saaty1961elements}. 
Most of the carriers charge users based on the traffic being transferred on to the Internet. 
The traffic demand of the users delivered to or from the Internet are noted as the total traffic served. 
In particular the total traffic served $X$, is represented as:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:goodput}
X=\sum_{w \in W, v \in V}T(w,v)
\end{equation}
$T(w,v)$ all delivered traffic between access point $v \in V$ and gateway node $w \in W$.

%To clarify the problem and approach the optimization solution of the problem, 
Here, we present a linear programming formulation to approach the optimal channel assignment in along the backhaul 
tier of a WhiteMesh network. 
We leverage the nodes into consider the set of available access points ($V$) which aggregate the traffic from the users, 
and gateways ($W$) as ingress points to the Internet. The available frequency bands ($B$) are pre-known 
as an input. The conflict graph $I$ is given as parameters. 
$\delta_b$ is the achieved channel capacity estimated from the  activity level measurements 
introduced in Section~\ref{sec:measurements}.

In this LP formulation, the constraints are presented as connectivity, uplink, and downlink sections here:

\label{opt:6}
& \sum_{i\neq j}\sum_b uy_{i,j,k}^b = \sum_{m\neq j} \sum_b uy_{j,m,k}^b \; ;w_j = 0\\

\end{align}
\noindent
{\bf Downlink Constraints:} 
\begin{align}

\label{opt:8}
& \sum_k \sum_b dy_{i,k,i}^b \leq D_{di} \; \; ; w_k=0 \\
\label{opt:9}
& dy_{i,j,k}^b =0  \; ;w_k=1 \\
%\label{opt:10}
%& \sum_j\sum_b dy_{i,j,k}^b - \sum_m\sum_b dy_{i,k,m}^b \geq , i \neq k \\
\label{opt:11}
& \sum_{i\neq j} \sum_b dy_{i,j,k}^b = \sum_{m \neq j} \sum_b dy_{j,m,k}^b   \; ; w_j=0, i \neq k \\
\label{opt:12}
& dy_{i,i,j}^b=0
\end{align}

In these constraints, (\ref{opt:1}) represents the total time assigned for the incoming flows, outgoing flows, 
and the interfering time which should all be less than 1. Constraint (\ref{opt:2}) represents that the incoming and 
outgoing wireless traffic are less than the capacity assigned for link $i,j$. Uplink constraints 
(\ref{opt:3}) and (\ref{opt:4}) represent that the total traffic flow on link $i,j$ from $i$ is less than 
the demand of node $i$. Constraints (\ref{opt:6}) and (\ref{opt:7}) restricts the sum of incoming data 
flows for a given access point $k$ equal to the total outgoing flows from the node. Downlink constraints 
(\ref{opt:8}) and (\ref{opt:9}) represent similar restrictions as (\ref{opt:3}) and (\ref{opt:4}), but 
in the downlink direction. Similarly, constraints (\ref{opt:11}) and (\ref{opt:12}) are downlink versions of 
(\ref{opt:6}) and (\ref{opt:7}).
Since linear programming models for multiple channels has been proved to be NP-hard~\cite{yuan2006cross},
in this work, we choose a small set cases to achieve the optimal solution.

\subsection{Path Interference Induced on the Network}
\label{subsec:PEN}

In WhiteMesh networks, it is possible that multihop paths are intermixed with WiFi bands for more spatial reuse 
and white space bands with hop count reduction. We analyze the band choices reducing the number of hops along 
a path and the aggregate level of interference on the network through the path(i.e., Path 
Interference induced on the Network).

Mesh nodes closer to the gateway generally achieve greater levels of throughput at sufficient-high 
offered loads. To combat the resulting starvation effects for downstream nodes, we treat each flow with equal priority in the network 
when assigning channels. To gurantee the service , all nodes along a particular path have equal time shares for 
contending links (i.e., intra-path interference). We begin the channel assignment assuming that $h$ mesh 
nodes are demanding traffic from each hop of an $h$-hop path to the gateway. If each link along the path 
uses orthogonal channels, then each link could be active simultaneously, otherwise they will compete with 
each other. We note each node along the path has traffic demand $T_d$. The bottleneck link 
along the path would be the one closest to the gateway. Thus, the total traffic along the 
path $h \cdot T_d$ must be less than the bottleneck link's achieved capacity $\delta$, estimated according 
to the measurements. The $h$-hop access point would achieve the minimum-served demand, which we define as the 
network efficiency. In general, the active time per link for an $h$-hop access point can be represented by 
$1,\frac{h-1}{h},\frac{h-2}{h}\cdots \frac{1}{h}$. The summation of all active times for each access point 
along the path is considered the intra-path network cost.


Using lower carrier frequencies allows a reduction in hop count and increase the network efficiency of each 
access point along the $h$-hop path by reducing the interference among the links of the path. However, a lower 
carrier frequency will induce greater interference to other paths to the gateway (i.e., inter-path interference). 
When an $h$-hop flow is transmitted to a destination node, it prevents activity on a number of links in the 
same frequency via the protocol model. The active time on a single link is noted as $\frac{T}{\gamma_h}$. 
An interfering link from the conflict matrix $F$ counts as $I_h$ per unit time and contributes to the network 
time cost in terms of:
$\frac{hT}{\gamma_1}\cdot I_1 + \frac{(h-1)T}{\gamma_2}\cdot I_2 \cdots \frac{T}{\gamma_h}\cdot I_h$.
Then, the traffic transmitted in a unit time of network cost for the $h$-hop node is:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:originpen}
E_{\eta}=\frac{T}{\sum_{i \in h}\frac{(h-i+1)\cdot T}{\gamma_i}\cdot I_i }
\end{equation}
Through network efficiency, the equation simplifies to:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:pen}
E_{\eta}=\frac{\gamma}{\sum_{i \in h} (h-i+1)\cdot I_i}
\end{equation}

Network efficiency is the amount of traffic that could be offered on a path per unit time. With 
multiple channels from the same band, $I_i$ will not change due to the common communication 
range. With multiple bands, $I_i$ depends on the band choice due to the communication range 
diversity. Network efficiency jointly considers hop count and interference in the paths. We define
the Path Interference induced on the Network (PIN) as the denominator of Eq.~\ref{eq:pen}.
The parameter represents the sum of all interfering links in the network by a given path. 

PIN is used to quantify the current state of channel for channel assignment across WiFi and 
white space bands. To determine when the lower carrier frequency will be better than two or 
more hops at a higher carrier frequency, we consider the average interference $\bar{I}$ of 
a given path at the higher frequency. The problem could be formulated as:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:benefit}
\frac{\gamma}{\frac{h(h-1)}{2}\cdot \bar{I}+I_x} \geq \frac{\gamma}{\frac{h(h+1)}{2}\cdot \bar{I}}
\end{equation}

Here, from Eq.~\ref{eq:benefit}, when $I_x \leq 2\cdot h\bar{I}$, the performance of a 
lower-frequency link has better network efficiency than two higher-frequency hops for 
the same destination node. $I_x$ is also a parameter of hop count in Eq.~\ref{eq:pen}. 
When the hop count is lower which closer to the gateway node, the threshold would be 
more strict since the interference would have a greater effect on the performance.


\subsection{Band-based Path Selection (BPS) Algorithm}
\label{subsec:BPS}

\caption{Example WhiteMesh topology with different mesh-node shapes 
representing different frequency band choices per link.}
\label{fig:interferencerange}
\vspace{-0.1in}
\end{figure}

% Intra network interference
Consider the following motivation example in Fig.~\ref{fig:interferencerange}, the access point $A$ could connect to access point $C$ 
relayed by node $B$ with 2.4 GHz, or directly connect to $C$ at 450 MHz. If 2.4 GHz were 
chosen, link $D,E$ is able to reuse 2.4 GHz when they are out of the interference range. 
However, along the backhaul tier, if link $A,C$ used 450 MHz, a lower hop count would 
result for the path, yet lower levels of spatial reuse also result (e.g., for link $D,E$). 
While the issues of propagation, interference, and spatial reuse are simple to understand, 
the joint use of white space and WiFi bands to form optimal WhiteMesh topologies is 
challenging since the optimization is based on the knowledge of prior channel assignment 
which is not available before the work has been done.

Thus, in the backhaul tier, we formulate the problem with a graph-based model. A connectivity 
graph $C$ is formed for each band in $B$ such that $C=(V,L,B)$. 
In the protocol model, if the received signal for a given band is above a threshold among 
nodes, the contention occurs for these nodes. 
We extend the conflict matrix in~\cite{tang2005interference} related to the interference per band according to 
$F=(E_{i,j},I_{Set},B)$, where $E_{i,j}$ represents the potential active link. 
$I_{Set}$ includes all the links are physically inside the interference range 
$D_r$ when there is an activite link working on band $b \in B$.

Therefore, the problem we model is: choose the connectivity graph $C'$ which maximizes the total traffic served 
from the access tier. A key challenge is that selecting the optimal channels from the 
set $B$ leads to a conflict graph $F$ which cannot be known {\it a priori}. 

%Previous works have proposed 
%several coloring, cluster-independent set, mixed linear integer methodology for a single band $b$ 
%~\cite{peng2012efficient,tang2005interference,doraghinejad2014channel}. 
%However, these works fails to address a reduction in hop count or an increase in spatial reuse and 
%channel occupancy for a set of diverse bands $B$.

We design a Band-based Path Selection (BPS) algorithm shown in Alg.~\ref{algorithms:bps}. 
The algorithm first chooses the access point that has the largest physical distance from the 
gateway nodes in the network to reduce the total time cost of the network avoiding multiple hop cost. 
When a path is constructed for the access point with the greatest distance, all 
subsequent access points along the path are also connected to the gateway. 
In large-scale mesh networks, the complexity makes it impractical to traverse all the 
paths with different combination of bands from an access point to any gateway node. It has been 
proved as an NP-hard problem. However, based on the discussion in Section~\ref{subsec:PEN}, 
if two paths have the same number of used bands along those paths, then the path with the 
least hops is likely to have the greatest performance and is chosen. Similarly, if two path 
have the same path interference, we choose the path which has higher-frequency links to keep 
the potential improvement of spatial reuse. Thus, the next step of the algorithm is to find 
the shortest path across band combinations.

In the algorithm, compared to the number of access points, the amount of channels $N_B$ in
different bands is small. The time complexity of calculating the combination is $O(2^{N_B})$. 
Finding the shortest path in Dijkstra algorithm will cost $O(N_E^2)$~\cite{golden1976shortest}, 
where as $N_E$ is the set of possible links in the network. As a result, the total complexity 
would be $O(N_E^2\cdot 2^{N_B})$. 
The algorithm will compare the PIN of the candidate paths and select the path with the 
least interference channel induced on the network for the source access point.
The algorithm updates the channel assignment of the network after the path is chosen.
Then, the set of served nodes, activated links, and radio information are updated. 
The process will repeat iteratively to assign channels for all the access points in the
network.

The complexity of assigning a channel for an access point is $O(N_E^2\cdot2^{N_B})$ 
if all the nodes are connected to gateway nodes ($N_E={n \choose 2}$ which is $O(N_V^2)$). 
The complexity of assigning an access point is $O(N_V^4\cdot2^{N_B})$.
To assign {\it all} the access points in the network, the complexity would be 
$O(N_V^5\cdot2^{N_B})$. The complexity is polynomial time of the number of traffic 
demands points (mesh group) for a wireless network assignment.


\subsection{Experimental Evaluation Setup}
\label{subsec:design}
% Simulation Setup
%WhiteMesh networks have the diversity in propagation from the lowest white space channels 
%(tens to hundreds of MHz) to the highest WiFi channels (multiple GHz). 
%We consider a wide range 
%of propagation characteristics from four different frequency bands to set up the experimental 
%evaluation. 
In the experiments, we use 450 MHz and 800 MHz of white space bands and 2.4 GHz and 5.2 GHz of WiFi bands
data from the spectral analysis in Section~\ref{sec:measurements}.
% Network Setup
%According to the population density for a given deployment location, we consider the spectral activity observed for 
%the population density from our in-field measurement.
We input the measurements to both the LP and heuristic-based algorithm to compare 
the performance in various scenarios. The communication threshold is set as -100 dBm. The 
communication range is normalized with the highest frequency of 5.2 GHz. Then, the communication 
range of 450 MHz, 800 MHz, 2.4 GHz, and 5.2 GHz would be normalized to 12.8, 6.2, 2.4, and 1, 
respectively in the Friis model (as Eq.~\ref{eq:friis}). 
The interference range is set to twice that of the communication range~\cite{raniwala2005architecture}. 
We deploy static wireless mesh networks of $n$ access points along a regular grid with a normalized 
distance of 0.8 between rectangular edges. The gateways are chosen through a typical cell hexagon 
deployment method based on 2.4 GHz~\cite{meguerdichian2001exposure}. Unless otherwise specified 
in the analysis, all four bands are used in the WhiteMesh topology studied. For practical application 
scenarios, more channels could be considered by BPS algorithm.


% Traffic generation
The traffic demand aggregated by an access point is independent to others and obeys a Poison distribution
per unit time. 
In the simulation, we generate an equal number of access points (including both gateway nodes and 
access points) Poison parameter $\lambda$. 
Then, we assign as the traffic demand for each access points in the 
target area.
% total traffic served calculation
As mentioned previously, the achieved wireless capacity of gateway nodes has been shown to be the 
bottleneck in mesh networks~\cite{robinson2010deploying}. Moreover, the amount of total traffic served is affected 
by access point placement, gateway placement, routing, and channel assignment. For the purposes 
of our analysis, we specifically calculate the total traffic served through a greedy strategy. 
We study the channel assignment process under a tree-based structure. 
To maximize the total traffic served, we start to serve the traffic demand from the gateway nodes. 
Mesh nodes that have a lower hop count path to the gateways are served first. 
When access points have the same hop count, the least interfering access points are chosen to 
reduce the cost for the whole network. When the paths have the same level of interference, the ties 
are broken by the nodes order.
The process repeats until no remaining traffic demand of users 
is unserved or no remaining channel capacity exists on any path.

We investigate the impacts of network size, band availablity, and channel occupancy on WhiteMesh networks 
in the simulations.
We assume 30\% of the residents will use the service. An individual user would have a 2 MBps 
traffic demand on average. Each radio has 600 MBps capacity as previous configuration.
We assign the traffic demand to users under the same Poison setting and 
run the analysis of each case 20 times. To approach the total traffic served upper bound, we relax our LP 
model to only keep the link capacity constraints, given the traffic demand of the access points as a 
parameter to achieve the maximum throughput at the gateways. We further compare BPS with the 
{\it (i)} Common Channel Assignment (CCA) from~\cite{draves2004routing},
and {\it (ii)} Breath First Search Channel Assignment (BFS-CA) from~\cite{tang2005interference}
under the same setup.
The CCA~\cite{draves2004routing} algorithm assigns a common channel for two nodes when both of them 
share available radios working on the same channel. In the BFS-CA~\cite{tang2005interference} algorithm, 
a node will search all the available single-hop connections and then choose the one that has the largest 
free capacity for a new assignment. 
These two methods are designed for multi-channel scenarios 
where each channel has the same propagation characteristics and spectral activity 
level of the algorithms.



\subsection{Experimental Analysis of WhiteMesh backhaul}
\label{subsec:wmanalysis}

\subsubsection{Network Size \& Bands Effect}

% ILP bound
Typically, the traffic patterns of access points from users are diverse with
the download direction dominating the total traffic demand (e.g., consider
service agreements for cellular data or Internet connectivity). 
Hence, to simplify the analysis and scale the LP Bound to larger network 
sizes, we only consider the download traffic in the simulations.

We investigate the network size impact on WhiteMesh networks. 
The number of access points is varied from $16$ to $64$ in the aforementioned 
regular grid. 
We choose the wired gateway according to a general hexagonal deployment.
Fig.~\ref{fig:varysize} shows the results of the total traffic served 
when the population distribution is 500 $ppl/km^2$ 
for the LP formulation and the heuristic-based algorithms: 
{\it (i)} Common Channel Assignment (CCA) from~\cite{draves2004routing},
{\it (ii)} Breadth First Search Channel Assignment (BFS-CA) from~\cite{ramachandran2006interference},
AND {\it (iii)} our algorithm BPS (Section~\ref{subsec:BPS}).

\label{fig:all3figs}
\vspace{-0.3in}
\end{figure}
%\end{figure*}

In Fig.~\ref{fig:varysize}, we observe the total traffic served increases with the network size. 
The multiband wireless network has a similar communication and interference performance with 
the multi-channel wireless network with a small network size for all algorithms. 
However, as the network size or population increases, the performance diverges between BPS and 
CCA/BFS-CA.
The nodes of a small network are located in a single interference space of all the bands.
The communication range variation of the bands impact on the network performance when the inter-node spacing become diverse. 
The LP Bound shows the upper-bound of total traffic served increases with the network size.
The multi-channel algorithms assign channels without considering the channel capacity diversity and the propagation 
differences per band. Hence, the performance 
is remains low across population densities. 
CCA fails to employ the communication range variation to find the most efficient multi hop paths. 
BFS-CA optimizes the first-hop connection from the gateway, but fails to deal the whole path 
from the gateway to destination node. Conversely, BPS alleviates the strain on these first-hop, 
bottleneck links, achieving average 76\% of the LP Bound. The gap of BPS to the LP is partly because 
BPS only considers a fixed multihop path to a gateway node for each access point, whereas the 
LP considers multiple paths to the gateways. For BPS and other heuristic-based algorithms, a dynamic 
assignment version could be implemented through updating the assignment as after path emerge.

we increase the average population distribution from 100 to 1,000 per $km^2$, while
maintaining a 49-node regular grid topology. The achieved channel capacity is mapped 
to the spectral analysis with the closest population distribution.

Fig.~\ref{fig:maxtpt} shows the correlation of the population distribution and total traffic served. 
Similar to Fig.~\ref{fig:varysize}, as shown in the figure, the wireless channel capacity of a 
gateway is saturated quickly when the algorithm fails to 
reduce the interference via resource allocation among the channels.
Also, the results show how the achieved channel capacity impacts on the performance. 
As the population density increases, the measurement-based channel capacity varies among multiple 
bands. When the population density reaches 1,000 $ppl$, the total traffic served decreases
due to the high measured activity level and the saturation of wireless channel capacity 
around the gateways. BPS 60\% achieve of the upper bound on average. 
The results shows that CCA and BFS-CA perform worse than BPS with limited exploration of 
propagation variation in the joint WiFi and white space scenarios.

To capture these varying degrees of demand 
and white space availability we consider three likely scenarios and another 
scenario for comparison purposes: {\it (i)} two WiFi band (2.4 and
5.2 GHz) channels with two white space channels (450 and 800 MHz), {\it (ii)} 
three channels in two WiFi bands (2.4 and 5.2 GHz) with one white space channel 
(450 MHz), {\it (iii)} Four channels in two WiFi bands (2.4 and 5.2 GHz) without 
any white space channels, and {\it (iv)} four channels in two white space bands 
(450 and 800 MHz) with no WiFi bands (for comparison).

Table~\ref{tab:2channelcombination} describes the total traffic served 
for various scenarios of WiFi and white space bands with an offered load 
of 5 Mbps as mean value of Poison process from 500 $ppl/km^2$ in a regular 49-node grid. 
We study the performance of BPS in the four aforementioned scenarios of varying 
white space availability. In the simulation, we keep total 4 channels for each
method, such as in the combination of 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz, we choose 2 channels in both 
bands. In the 3-band combinations, we have one channel from each band, and put the 
other channel in the highest frequency band. (In 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, 800 MHz combination, 
we put the extra channel other than these $3$ in the 5 GHz band). 
% Justification
In the results, we observe that the WiFi-only scenario has greater total traffic served 
than the white-space-only scenario. This is due to the lack of spatial reuse achieved 
by white spaces bands. 
Another reason is that the achieved channel capacity of 500 $ppl/km^2$ in white 
space bands is less than the WiFi bands. These two reasons make the performance of 
white space only scenario worse in all channel assignment methods applied here.
Interestingly, however, the joint use of both white space and WiFi bands has 
significant gains over the single type of band scenarios with the same number of 
channels (40\% greater than WiFi and 56\% over white space, on average). 

%In 500 $ppl/km^2$ scenario, 5 GHz channel is cleaner than 450 MHz which makes 
%the combination of 2 channels in 5 GHz, 1 channel in 2.4 GHz and 800 MHz has 
%better performance than WiFi(2)+WS(2) in some cases. 


In Table~\ref{tab:2channelcombination}, we observe that the total traffic served greatly depends on these spectral activity of the channel.
With similar achieved channel capacity, the lower frequency band
offers more option for the multihop path to perform better. 
If we have one channel in a white space band and one channel in a WiFi band, then 
we could employ the advantages of both WiFi for spatial reuse and white spaces to 
reduce the hop count in channel assignment, for particular multihop paths. 

\subsubsection{Access Tier Impacts on backhaul Tier}

The density of access points increases proportionally to the population 
density to offer enough access capacity for the users. 
Hence, the distance among the access points and the channel 
occupancy in backhaul tier channel assignment should be leveraged.
To investigate impacts of the spacing variation and channel occupancy in the access tier 
on the backhaul tier, we perform simulation on a 49-node regular grid WhiteMesh network as
described before. 

In Fig.~\ref{fig:actspac}, we show the impacts of channel occupancy through 
the activity level and spacing variation on WhiteMesh network. 
In the results, all the bands have the same activity level in the 49-nodes regular 
grid with an inter-node spacing which is normalized from 
0.2 to 2.1 as discussed in Subsection~\ref{subsec:design}. In the 3-D figure, 
as the activity level increases, the total traffic served decreases due to the reduction 
of achieved channel capacity. In the spatial dimension, when the nodes have extremely
small spacing, lacking the propagation diversity of multiple bands and spatial reuse  make the total traffic served
limited as we have analyzed in Fig~\ref{fig:varysize}. 
As the inter-node spacing increases, the high frequency bands
bring higher total traffic served via more spatial reuse. 
As the inter-node spacing increases, the higher frequency links fail due to the limited 
communication range. The number of available channels reduction leads the total traffic served 
reduce sharply as shown in the figures.

We further study BPS with the real world inter-node spacing variation through BPS and in-field measurements.
Based on the analysis in Section~\ref{sec:problemformulation}, the distance between mesh nodes decrease 
with the population increment.
We arbitrarily map the largest population distribution in Table~\ref{tab:activitymeasurement} to 
represent the spacing as normalized distance of 0.2, and the least population distribution 
as a normalized inter-node spacing of distance 1.7. In a regular grid the inter-node spacing distance $D_s$, population 
distribution $P_d$ and access point capacity $M_c$ obey $P_d \cdot \frac{D_s}{2} ^2 \propto M_c$. 
We interpolate activity level for each normalized distance from 0.2 to 1.7 with gap 0.1. 
The results of the heuristic-based algorithms and the results are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:measurespacing}.

\end{figure}

In Fig.~\ref{fig:measurespacing}, as the spacing increases, the WhiteMesh network 
has the best performance in all methods through spatial reuse, matching the simulation 
analysis shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:actspac}. As the distance increases up to normalized 
distance 1, one of the 5 GHz channels stops working in the network since the distance 
is larger than its communication range, decreasing the performance sharply.

Through our analysis, a mixed WiFi and white space wireless network 
improves the performance in the following aspects: 
{\it (i)} Heavily utilized networks can get more capacity from spatial reuse and 
hop count reduction from frequency agility. 
{\it (ii)} Rural networks have large mesh spacing to be deployed with a reasonable network performance 
with a greatly reduced deployment cost.
