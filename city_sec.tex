\section{Propogation of Typical Cities}
\label{sec:cities}


To access to the white space usability, people should be careful of both the FCC rules in different cities and the different propagation characteristics of their environment.
There are four kind of cities according to the combo of these two parameters: 
more white space band and lower propagation; less white space band and lower propagation; more white space band and higher propagation; less white space band and higher propagation.
These are the scenarios we are going to deal with.
