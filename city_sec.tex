% Intro different scenarios, should we keep it or merge it to the previous SEC...


To access to the white space usability, FCC rules have to be obeyed. 
FCC has assigned white space with different bandwidth according to the population density and geographical condition across US.
There are cities which reserve a narrow white space band for TV and release more bandwidth for research and other utility.
There are also cities reserver more white space band for TV and only release few bandwidth for research and other utility.

Combined with the propagation characteristics, there are four scenarios we are trying to leverage the influence of the white space mesh deployment.
more white space band and lower propagation; less white space band and lower propagation; more white space band and higher propagation; less white space band and higher propagation.
These are the scenarios we are going to deal with for FIXME algorithms.
