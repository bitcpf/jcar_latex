\section{Experimental Analysis for Prediction Algorithms}
\label{sec:experiment_design}
In this section, 

% Creation of virtual cities 
To evaluate our algorithms, four scenarios mapping four different kinds of cities are involved in our experiments. FIXME 




% Find AP location methodology




% Scenario cities analysis, experimental set up of different propagation/channel bandwidth
