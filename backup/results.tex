\subsection{Performance Analysis of Algorithms}
\label{subsec:results}

We now investigate the performance of our proposed
multiband network placement algorithms in different scenarios.
First we analyze the performance of the two algorithms in a 7x7 regular grid whose mesh nodes could be installed on the cross points.
Then we put the algorithms on in-field network placment of TFA and Google network.
