Many efforts has been devoted to resolve the channel assignment problem for multi-channel multi-radio mesh network these years.
The solutions of these works are approaching the optimization by local search algorithms and graph theory.
In this paper, we propose a multiband multiradio wireless mesh networking architecture, where each mesh node has multiple radios working in a set of frequency bands with different propagation characteristics.
A mixed integer linear model is presented for multiband multiradio network. 
To resolve this NP-Hard problem, we first present a novel parameter network efficience to describe the network performance and present two algorithms to approach the optimization.
Our simulation results shows that these two algorithms can resolve the problem in polynomial time with good results. We also compare our solutions to multi-channel solutions FIXME. The results shows that our algorithms is more fitted for multiband channel assignment problem.
