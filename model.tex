\section{White Space Mesh Deployment}
\label{sec:model}

% Organization of the Sec
In this section, we first formulate the 
white mesh deployment problem
with propagation, connectivity and QOS constraint of multiband sceniario.
We then propose {FIXME} white mesh deployment algorithms for multiband multihop networks objectives.
%trageting to improve the network capacity with the same topology and reduce the mesh nodes for the same coverage of an area. 
For comparison, we also propose {FIXME} baseline assignment methods based on existing solutions.

\subsection{Problem Formulation}
% Objective
The objective of the mesh node placement problem in multiband scenario could either be 
to minimize the number of deployed mesh nodes and relay nodes with the constraint of fulfilling coverage of the target area and connectivity to the Internet existing users. 
or to maximize the capacity of existing mesh network topology with replacing ISM Wifi nodes to white space nodes.

% Input & Output
The set of potential mesh node accessing to Internet locations, $M$, is assumed know. 
Discrete locations for mesh nodes follows naturally from pratical constraints on deployment, such as the availability of wired connection store or other infrastructure for mesh node installation.
The coverage area of the mesh network is discretized into small grid of coverage locations $N$. The center of each grid is the point output the received signal justifying the connection and channel capacity.
Relay nodes $R$  are defined as nodes do not have direcet Internet access but can connect to the mesh node and provide Wi-fi coverage of a number of grid.
Relay nodes and mesh nodes could work in white space band and ISM Wifi band represented as bands set $B$.
The vertex set of the input is defined as $O=M\cup N$,the union of  coverage grid and the potential mesh nodes location. 
The solution of the problem could tell which mesh node will be built and where should a relay node be added. The set of chosen mesh nodes is represented as $M_b$. 
The output of the problem is the nodes location and number of wireless nodes $R\cup M_b$, the union of mesh nodes chosen from potential locations and the relay nodes. 


% Connectivity constraint
\subsection{Coverage Constraint}
\label{subsec:ccconstraint}
The connctivity graph represented as $G=(V,E)$ could indicate the existence of usable links. This formulation encodes the signal quality of each link independently can represent the link quality diversity across bands.
The links set, $E$, from the coverage grids $V$ to either relay nodes or mesh node $O$, corresponding to the estimated or measured signal strength is above a signal strength threshold. 
More formally, the connectivity graph where both target coverage locations and potential mesh node locations form a unified connectivity graph.
The mesh network have to satisfy the coverage of each grid through an edge $E$ from either a mesh node or a relay node $O$.
Each coverage grid $v_i\in {V}$ has $E_{B_j},{B_j}\in {B}$ valued ${0,1}$, which represents the signal strength is below threshold as 0 or above threshold as 1 in band $B_j$.
The sum of $E$ in band is also valued $(0,1)$, which means the grid has connection or not.
According to the defination of $E$, mapping to the connectivity constraint, it should satisfy $\sum{E}\geq V$.






\subsection{Mesh Network Capacity}
Wireless bandwidth is shared among all clients and mesh nodes, as a result, it is offen desirable to limit the number of potential sharers of the scarce wireless spectrum. 
The link $E$ \ref{subsec:ccconstraint} could gurantee the minimum bandwidth sharing for the client, however, it could not represent the quality of the service. Our formulation enforces this by imposing a maximum degree $b_v=f(E,P_{rB})$ on the connectivity of a mesh node, represented the downlink/uplink capacity of the mesh node to clients. More complete capacity of formulations in other research take into account on-demands and fairness ~\cite{arkoulis2013optimal}, but we do not get into these scenarios in this paper.


% Note the capacity gain of putting white space nodes
Subject to the ~\emph{Coverage Constraint} \ref{subsec:ccconstraint}, the capacity of mesh network is the sum of bandwidth assigned for each grid $\sum{b_v}$. If the metric would be the capacity of mesh network, as the ISM Wifi mesh network has capacity $C_{ISM}$, white space mesh network has capacity $C_{ws}$, the capacity gain could be noted as $C_{ws}-C{ISM}$.
% Note the gain of reducing mesh nodes
The gain of minimize deployment mesh node could be noted as the nodes amount of ISM Wifi mesh network $A_{ISM}$ minus the nodes amount of mesh network with white space nodes $A_{ws}$, $G_a=A_{ISM}-A_{ws}$.


To employ the propagation advantages brings a NP-hard problem to arrive the optimal solution~\cite{arkoulis2013optimal}. 
To approach the optimal solution we have FIXME frameworks to solve part of the problem subject to time fairness of each node.
