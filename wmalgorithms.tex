We design a Band-based Path Selection (BPS) algorithm
(described in Alg.~\ref{algorithms:bps}) which first chooses the 
mesh node that has the largest physical distance from the gateway 
nodes to reduce the whole time cost of the network. When a path is constructed for
the mesh node with the greatest distance, all subsequent mesh nodes along
the path are also connected to the gateway. The intuition behind the
BPS algorithm is to improve the worst mesh node performance in a path.
In large-scale mesh networks, it is impractical to traverse all the paths with
different combination of bands from a mesh node to any gateway node since 
it is a NP-hard problem. However,
based on the discussion in Section~\ref{subsec:PEN}, if two paths have the same
number of used bands along those paths, then the path with the least hops
is likely to have the greatest performance and is chosen.  Similarly, if
two path have the same path interference, we choose the path which has
higher-frequency links for spatial reuse. Thus, the next step of the
algorithm is to find the shortest path across band combinations.

To run the algorithm, compared to the number of mesh nodes, the amount of channels $N_B$ in
different bands is small. The time complexity of calculating the combination
is $O(2^{N_B})$. Finding the shortest path in Dijkstra algorithm will
cost $O(N_E^2)$ according to~\cite{golden1976shortest}, where $N_E$ is the set of possible links in the
network, and as a result, the total complexity would be $O(N_E^2\cdot 2^{N_B})$.
The algorithm would then calculate the PIN of the candidate path and select the path
with the least interference channel induced on the network for the source mesh node.
After a path is assigned, the algorithm updates the network's channel assignment
with served nodes, activated links, and radio information. Then,
we iteratively assign channels for all the mesh nodes in the
network.

If all the nodes are connected to gateway nodes ($N_E={n \choose 2}$ which is $O(N_V^2)$), 
then the complexity of assigning a channel for a mesh node is $O(N_E^2\cdot2^{N_B})$. 
Then, the complexity of assigning a mesh node is $O(N_V^4\cdot2^{N_B})$.
To assign {\it all} the nodes in the network, the complexity would 
be $O(N_V^5\cdot2^{N_B})$. The complexity is polynomial time of
the number of traffic demands points (client group) for a wireless
network assignment.
