\subsection{Multiband Gateway Placement Problem}
\label{subsec:placementproblem}

Multiband gateway placement problme could be defined as follows. Let $G$ be a (0,1)-vector of size n that indicates whether a given mesh node $i$ is a capacity point or not. $f[i]$ is the monetary cost of installing a gateway capacity point $i$.
The total cost $C(G)$ of multiband mesh network installation can be represented as:

\begin{equation}
C(G)=\sum_{} f[i] \times G[i]
\end{equation}

The placement problem is difficult since it has multiple subproblems, such as gateway selection, client assignment to gateways. 

\subsection{Local Search Approaching}
Previous work has found that the problem could be expressed as an integer program. J, Robinson proposed two ~\emph{Local search algorithms} to optimize the capacity for single band mesh network deployment ~\cite{robinson2008adding}.
We therefore develop the ~\emph{Local Search Algorithms}

% Foreach all mesh nodes


% Have a network already build or built a single band network

% Add a node

% Connect to all gateway nodes to see if can remove them according

% Try to keep the demand and remove relay node


% calculate the capacity

% Calculate the cost

% Update the deployment
