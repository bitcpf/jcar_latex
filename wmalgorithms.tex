\section{Mixed Multiband Path Analysis}
\label{sec:wmalgorithms}


In this section, we discuss the influence of ~\emph{Multiband} on ~\emph{Multihop Path} in mesh network. 
Accodirng to these analysis, we develop two algorithms for ~\emph{Channel Assignment} in multi-band multi-radio scenario.

% PEN part 
\input{networkefficiency}


The discussion in \~ref{subsec:PEN} provide the methodology to improve channel assignment. But the difficulty of channel assignment is that before the process has been done, it could no be evaluated to tell which is better.
To approach the solution, we propose two local search based heuristic algorithms to adapt the multiband scenario. 


\subsection{Growing Spanning Tree Algorithm}
In a mesh network, gateway nodes always building in the most busy location ~\cite{robinson2008adding, he2008optimizing}.
As the service tree rooted at a gateway grows, the links closer to the gateway, the more interference will happen.
And in the edge of the network, it is less populated in which cases reduce hop count through lower frequency may bring more benefit. 
The main idea behind the ~\emph{Growing Spanning Tree} Algorithm is 
to find the link has least interference on the network for each node in a greedy manner each step. The hop count for gateway nodes themselves are 0.
We first initialize the mesh nodes ranking with the distance to all the gateway nodes. In the ranking order of the mesh nodes, the 1 hop links from gateway nodes ranking with the ~\emph{Path Interference}. Then select the lowest interferred link for this node and update the assignment information for next steps. 
Iterate these steps to assign channels for all mesh nodes. This process is phase 1 of our algorithm which is similar to but not exactly the same as the breath first search channel assignment. 

In phase 2 of the algorithm, we sort the mesh nodes with their hop count to gateway nodes. 
The algorithm traverses all the nodes whose hop count are less than the current node. If there are radio slots for the less hop nodes, it is possible to re-connect the mesh node to reduce the hop count. We rank all possible option with their path interference, then choose the lowest one re-connect the mesh node. If there exist new link has the same path interference, we count the number of nodes has connected to the gateway nodes, select the gateway has less node connected. Phase 2 process will be interated till no changes in the network.

The ~\emph{Growing Spanning Tree} Algorithm is described in ~\ref{algorithms:gsp}.

\WHILE {Change of Channel Assignment Exist} 
\FORALL {$s \in N_{sorted}$}
	\STATE Tranverse all the 1 hop arrived nodes have less hop count than node $s$ 
	\STATE Check if these nodes have radio slots for node $s$
	\STATE Sort path through possible nodes with the path interference
	\STATE Choose a new path if it has less interference than the previous one
	\STATE If more than one path has the same interference, choose the gateway node has least leaves nodes

%FIXME need more explaination of the tree growing algorithm
%The algorithm use the average $\bar{I}$ and average hop count to approach the channel assignment
%In ~\cite{robinson2008adding}, Robinson talked about the bottle neck of a network is the links neighbor to the gateway nodes.





\subsection{Best Path Selection Algorithm}
\label{subsec:step}

Based on the previous path efficiency analyze, the network efficiency is related to each link's interference and the distance to gateway nodes. To find a path for each mesh node, which could be converge to a shortest weight path detect
We define weight for each link and improve Dijikstra's algorithm with ~\emph{PEN} weight to find the best path for each mesh node ~\cite{golden1976shortest}.
To run Dijikstra's algorithm, we define two parameter of each link between two nodes. First is the existing interference of the link $I_w$, we mark the interference of bands as multiple links. 
The second is the ~\emph{Load Weight} of a link $l_w$, which is the number of path chosen this link. In Dijikstra's algorithm, the weight is calculated as denominator of ~\emph{PEN}, since the numerator is the same among different bands.
This parameter used to adjust the ~\emph{PEN} with bottle neck links.
The weight of Dijikstra's algorithm is related to hop order $h_i$ according to the definition of ~\emph{PEN}, the weight is calculated as $I_w\times h_i \times \l_w$.
We iterately find the best path of each node and update the parameters in the graph.
